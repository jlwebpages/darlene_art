Thank you for taking a look at my work.
<p>
I am a mixed media artist in Orange, CA. I am inspired by the landscape that surrounds me, which includes rolling hills that lead into southern California mountain ranges, and by the photographs I take while hiking. I use acrylic paints, a variety of mark making tools, and collage, and I often sand back to reveal underlying layers before building on top of them again. Sometimes I include pieces of my photographs, through collage or image transfer, when constructing a piece. Textures, relationships, seasonal changes, and climate change are some of the themes that you will find explored within my work.

A life-long art enthusiast, I began my art-making career about 15 years ago after parenting three sons and having a variety of volunteer, teaching, and engineering positions. What began as casual photography and journaling while hiking led to an interest in composition and finding creative ways to use my images and ideas, directly and indirectly, in mixed media pieces. My work has been included in juried exhibitions and sold in galleries.
