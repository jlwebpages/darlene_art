Vacation is a great time to explore new land - and recently I visited the comfortably cool central coast of CA and took a hike along the coast. To my right was the Pacific Ocean, and to my left was a vast field of surprisingly colorful coastal scrub brush, with a few trees and low mountains in the distance.
